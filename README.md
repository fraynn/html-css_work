# HTML & CSS work

## Description
Here are 3 exercises, named in the order they were made in.

The last two were made using Sass (mostly for the nesting). The first one is in basic CSS.

## Context
- Only the pictures inside each folder were given
- HTML & CSS written from scratch
- No pixel perfect reproduction : made with eyes only (and a color picker)
